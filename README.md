## Quick start

### Install

Download and install the latest Steampipe plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install jenkins
```

Configure your [credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/jenkins#credentials) and [config file](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/jenkins#configuration).

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/jenkins.spc`:

```hcl
connection "jenkins" {
  plugin = "jenkins"

  # Your Jenkins instance URL
  server_url = "https://ci-cd.internal.my-company.com"

  # Authentication information
  username = "admin"
  password = "aqt*abc8vcf9abc.ABC"
}
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export JENKINS_URL=https://ci-cd.internal.my-company.com
export JENKINS_USERNAME=admin
export JENKINS_PASSWORD=aqt*abc8vcf9abc.ABC
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List FreeStyle jobs on your Jenkins instance:

```sql
select
  color,
  name,
  in_queue,
  last_completed_build  ->> 'URL' as last_completed_build
from
  jenkins_freestyle;
```

```
